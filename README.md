## About Version file
the version file `VERSIONS.txt` Will be generated at release time,
and will use the released title.

You generally don't need to worry about this file during
development. However, if the version.txt file doesn't exist,
(just like cloned code) it will default to 'dev-version'.

If you are using the released version, updating Waapuro will
add the new version code to the last line of VERSIONS.txt. 
You can read VERSIONS.txt to view the update history, and the 
last line will indicate your current version.
